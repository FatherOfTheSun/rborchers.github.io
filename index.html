                My name is Reese Borchers, I have recently just begun to be a full-stack devleoper
                My fiance Ashley is my other half, I wouldnt be here without her, she has her degree 
                in Graphic Design. We have two wonderful boys, Asher is 7 and Apollo is 18 months. 
                We are a very active family and enjoy any sport or activity from Snowboarding in 
                Colorado to Paddleboarding or Wakeboarding at the Lake. In my spare time I enjoy 
                researching green energy and new farming technics, in hopes to help provide a new 
                ways of being self-effienct.
